# Main Config

Besides the nuxt.config file we need to have 2 important files:

1. [dragonConfig.ts](dragonConfig.ts)
2. [papagayoConfig.ts](papagayoConfig.ts)

The **dragonConfig** is an autogenerated file that is created on every prebuild. Essentially the front-end doesn't
need to
do anything here besides from setting the right project key on [package.json](..%2Fpackage.json) config object.

The **papagayoConfig** file holds a global front-end config that we can use across the project. We can update, add,
remove or scale this config depending on the project needs.

Both of these objects are available globally, so you don't need to import them.

> Note that we already have set some essentials constants that we think will serve well from project to project, If you
> consider that we should add more generic values
> just [open a new issue](https://github.com/NovatagSource/nuxt-template/issues) on nuxt-template repo.

The reason these files have peculiar names is that initially there was just one file called appConfig, the problem
with that name is that conflicts with a conditional NuxtJs file that is called appConfig, this file can be created on
the
project's root to add more reactive configuration if
needed. [Learn more about it here](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/app-config).
